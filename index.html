        <h1 style="font-size:80px;">Why organizing your time is important!</h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Time planning is essential for several reasons.
            First, it significantly impacts productivity and efficiency.
            When you plan your time, you allocate it effectively to tasks and goals,
            ensuring that you make the most of each day. Second,
            time planning contributes to reduced stress.
            A well-organized schedule reduces last-minute rushes and panic,
            allowing you to know what to expect and handle situations calmly.
            In summary,
            time planning empowers you to lead a purposeful,
            balanced life and achieve your goals like all IB class students :) !</p>

    <h2 style="font-size:80px;">Start Your Day with a Plan</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a to-do list of tasks you want to accomplish.</li>
        <li>Prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency.</li>
        <li>Physically cross off completed tasks to track your progress and feel accomplished.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="font-size:80px;">Divide Larger Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Break down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks.</li>
        <li>Focusing on smaller pieces makes it easier to get started and reduces overwhelm.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 style="font-size:80px;">Conduct a Time Audit</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Assess where you spend your time.</li>
        <li>Create a visual map of hours spent on work, school, chores, social media, etc.</li>
        <li>Set goals based on this analysis and allocate time intentionally.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 style="font-size:65px;">Organize Yourself</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Use tools like calendars, planners, or digital apps.</li>
        <li>Write down daily tasks, appointments, and schedules.</li>
        <li>Set reminders to stay on track.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The pomodoro technique could be used as well for organizing your time. But i believe that it is not that useful.</p>
